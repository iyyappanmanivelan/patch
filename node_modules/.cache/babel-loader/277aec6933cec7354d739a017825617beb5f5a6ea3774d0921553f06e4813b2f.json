It was\r\n                June. The King and Queen were at the Palace. And everywhere,\r\n                though it was still so early, there was a beating, a stirring of\r\n                galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot,\r\n                Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh of the\r\n                grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind\r\n                them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing\r\n                ponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they\r\n                sprung, the whirling young men, and laughing girls in their\r\n                transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing all night, were\r\n                taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run; and even now, at this\r\n                hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor\r\n                cars on errands of mystery; and the shopkeepers were fidgeting\r\n                in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old\r\n                sea-green brooches in eighteenth-century settings to tempt\r\n                Americans (but one must economise, not buy things rashly for\r\n                Elizabeth), and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd\r\n                and faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were\r\n                courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going\r\n                that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party. But\r\n                how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the\r\n                hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling;\r\n                and who should be coming along with his back against the\r\n                Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch\r\n                box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old\r\n                friend Hugh--the admirable Hugh!\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                \"Good-morning to you, Clarissa!\" said Hugh, rather\r\n                extravagantly, for they had known each other as children. \"Where\r\n                are you off to?\"\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                \"I love walking in London,\" said Mrs. Dalloway. \"Really it's\r\n                better than walking in the country.\"\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </main>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,qBAAqB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AAEzC,SAASC,KAAKA,CAAA,EAAG;EACf,oBACEH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;QAAMK,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;QAAAD,QAAA,eACvBJ,OAAA;UAAKM,KAAK,EAAC,MAAM;UAAAF,QAAA,gBACfJ,OAAA;YAAKM,KAAK,EAAC,YAAY;YAAAF,QAAA,eACrBJ,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,gBACEJ,OAAA;gBAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAQ,CAAC,eACTV,OAAA;gBAAKM,KAAK,EAAC;cAAW;gBAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eAC7BV,OAAA;gBAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;cAAiB;gBAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OAAI,CAAC;YAAA;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OACvB;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNV,OAAA;YAAKM,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;YAAAF,QAAA,gBACvBJ,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;YAA2B;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAEpCV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAAqD;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE5DV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAKH;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAqBH;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAQH;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAqBH;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAgCH;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAIH;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJV,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;YAGH;cAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAG,CAAC;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACD,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACF;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACA;EAAC,gBACV,CAAC;AAEP;AAACC,EAAA,GAnIQR,KAAK;AAqId,eAAeA,KAAK;AAAC,IAAAQ,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
